# Food Ordering Management System

This frontend web application is designed to facilitate an efficient online food ordering system within our college campus. Customers can select their preferred restaurant, browse through the menu, and, uniquely, the system provides an estimated waiting time for their food. This feature allows users to plan ahead and place orders in a timely manner, ensuring minimal waiting time upon arrival.

The primary motivation behind this initiative is to address the time constraints faced by students during class hours. By offering an insight into the anticipated waiting time, the application empowers users to make informed decisions, allowing them to order food strategically and optimize their limited free time. The goal is to streamline the food ordering process, making it more convenient for students and enabling them to enjoy their meals without unnecessary delays.

It's important to note that this project exclusively focuses on the frontend aspect, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. The intention behind the development is rooted in enhancing the overall experience of students on campus by minimizing wait times and promoting a more relaxed dining environment.
